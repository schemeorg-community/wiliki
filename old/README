This directory contains the original "quick and dirty" version of
WiLiKi script.  The first version is 131 lines of code (without
comments & blank lines), which is simple enough for those who want
to grasp the basic idea of Wiki engine.

Note that the scripts contain EUC-JP characters, so it won't run
unless your Gauche is compiled with EUC-JP as the native encoding.
